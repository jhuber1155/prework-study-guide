# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created as a reference tool to utilize when going through a coding bootcamp for continuing education adult learners. It should be used often when faced with obstacles in the coding course. In it you will find helpful topics regarding the basics of coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, also known as front-end coding for websites.

This project was created with the intention of helping new students gain confidence in their coding abilities by providing them supporting tools and references when facing the difficulties of learning at an accelerated pace or on their own time without the immediate aide of a teacher or knowledgeable mentor.

This guide was written in hopes of providing a resource to new students to refer to and use as a supplement to their lessons from the coding boot camp. It will provide a series of examples and commands which students can use to jog their memories about the days lessons and classwork.

As an example, this study guide will reference Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), its structuring, parent and child elements, and how to upload your work to GitHub using the methodology known as Git Flow. In regards to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), this guide will help students understand how to create a CSS file using Git Flow, how to link the CSS file to the HTML index file, creating and using different attributes (such as margin, padding, and classes). Finally this guide will help a student understand Javascript, how to write variables and functions, how to use and incorporate conditional logic, and how to create arrays and refrence those arrays in for loops.
